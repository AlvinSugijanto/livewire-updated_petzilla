## Project Description

Petzilla is a web application designed to revolutionize the way pet enthusiasts buy and sell pets online. It is a pet e-commerce platform that aims to connect pet lovers with reputable sellers in their vicinity. The application includes features such as radius-based product filtering, real-time chat functionality using Pusher, and a health certification process for sellers to ensure the well-being of the pets being sold.

## Notable Features

## Radius-Based Product Filtering
Petzilla implements a "Radius-Based Product Filtering" feature to ensure pet safety by limiting transactions to a specific distance from the user's address, preventing prolonged journeys that could be potentially dangerous.

## Real-Time Chat using Pusher
Petzilla includes a real-time chat system powered by Pusher that allows seamless communication between buyers and sellers. This instant messaging feature fosters direct and efficient communication, helping buyers clarify their queries, negotiate prices, and discuss pet-related details in real-time.

## Seller Health Certification
To prevent any fraud or irresponsible seller. Petzilla requires sellers to provide documentation certifying the health and well-being of the pets they wish to sell. This feature ensures that only healthy and properly cared-for pets are made available on the platform, fostering trust and confidence among potential buyers.
